## Professional Experience

**Founder, Quantitative Researcher & C++/Python Developer** | TMRW | Remote
*January 2021 – Present*
Founded and independently led the end-to-end development of "TMRW," a proprietary algorithmic trading platform focused on cryptocurrency and equity markets. Responsible for all aspects from theoretical research and system design to C++ and Python implementation, deployment, and optimization.
* **Crypto Trading Systems:** Engineered and deployed ultra-low-latency crypto trading bots in Python and C++ for market making, arbitrage, and exploiting new token listings (e.g., on Raydium via Solana). Integrated with multiple major crypto exchange APIs (Binance, Coinbase, OKX) for live trading and real-time data ingestion (order books, trades).
* **System Architecture & Optimization:** Designed and implemented a modular, scalable research and trading infrastructure. Leveraged Python for rapid prototyping, data analysis, and ML model development, and C++ for performance-critical components of the trading execution logic and backtesting engine. Focused on creating cleanly architected, extensible, and testable systems.
* **Strategy Development & Research:** Researched and implemented a diverse portfolio of trading strategies, including statistical arbitrage and AI-driven models (regime detection, volatility forecasting). Developed a novel geometric-information framework for market modeling.
* **Performance:** Achieved a ~13% return in an initial live crypto trading deployment. Secured top 0.5% global rank (107th/12,000+) in the IMC Prosperity 3 algorithmic trading challenge, implementing market-making and stat-arb strategies in Python.

**Freelance Software Developer (Crypto Focus)** | Self-Employed | Remote
*May 2024 – January 2025 (Concurrent with TMRW development)*
* Developed a Python-based low-latency trading system for clients to capitalize on meme-coin IPOs on the Raydium market (Solana blockchain).
* Created custom Pine Script algorithms on TradingView for automated crypto trade execution based on client-defined signals.

**Junior Quantitative Developer** | LD Pensions | Copenhagen, Denmark
*August 2023 – May 2024*
Contributed to developing quantitative tools and data infrastructure.
* **Python Development:** Built and maintained a modular, object-oriented Python framework for quantitative analysis, risk modeling (VaR/CVaR), and portfolio management, emphasizing code reusability and maintainability.
* **Data Pipelines & Automation:** Designed automated ETL processes using Python and SQL for financial data ingestion and unification from sources like Bloomberg and MSCI.

## Selected Projects

**Galaksim - Astrophysics N-Body Simulation (C++)**
* Developed a high-performance N-body simulation in C++ to model galaxy formation dynamics, applying optimized numerical methods for gravitational interactions. Demonstrates strong C++ programming skills and experience with computationally intensive problem-solving.

**TMRW - Quantitative Research & Trading Framework (Python, C++)**
* The core platform described under professional experience. Included development of a custom backtesting engine, ML model integration, and live trading modules. Emphasis on robust, version-controlled (Git) software development practices.

**IMC Prosperity 3 Algorithmic Trading Challenge (Python)**
* Achieved top 0.5% global rank. Developed and implemented market-making (Avellaneda-Stoikov) and statistical arbitrage algorithms in Python under competitive, real-time simulated market conditions. Validated ability to rapidly develop and deploy effective trading logic.

## Education

**B.Sc. in Mathematics & Technology** | Danish Technical University (Expected 2025-2027)
* Relevant Coursework (Planned/In-Progress): Advanced Python Programming, Mathematical Statistics, Stochastic Processes.

**Previous University Studies (Mathematical Statistics & Physics)** | University of Copenhagen (2017-2024)
* Thesis (Math Stats): "Option Pricing with Stochastic Volatility in the Heston Model" (developed as an R library).
* Coursework included: Differential Geometry, Advanced Probability Theory.

## Awards & Certifications (Selected)
