# Volatility questions

**Artur Sepp**
- “In your modeling or trend-following framework, how do you differentiate between temporary volatility spikes—say from market noise or events—and more structural regime changes in volatility dynamics? Are there specific statistical signals or filters you rely on?”

- “Do you integrate macroeconomic or cross-asset signals into your volatility forecasts for longer horizons, and if so, how do you balance that with the responsiveness needed for short-term risk models?”

- “Given the increasing heterogeneity in volatility behavior across time scales, what methods do you find most robust for forecasting short- vs long-term volatility? Do you see machine learning techniques overtaking traditional models like HAR or GARCH for this purpose?”

- "“How do you recommend adjusting asset exposure or inventory in anticipation of—or in response to—extreme volatility events? Do you use forward-looking metrics like implied skew, or backward-looking stress test models?”"
