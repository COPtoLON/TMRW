# Model - Market
The following parts are pieces to the model we expect to use as an approximation to the markets in which we operate.:
- **Market**
  - **Market variables** -  transaction costs, opening/closing times, date, execution delay, maximum orders per day, etc.
  - **Market State** - A summary of the agents behaviour and the market value history makes the market state
- **Agents** - A collection of market participants or agents, each having corresponding information
  - **Agent goals** - Each agent has a goal aiming to extract and maximize value from the market. 
  - **Agent dynamics** - Each agent can perform a range of actions, each agent has a relationship to the other agents, and an information coefficient, there will be considerations on agent sizes
  - **Agent variables** - Each agent has a resistance to other agents, a consideration on the correct price range and an opinion of which direction the price should move, they also have a trading book(money in the bank, portfolio, etc.)
  - **Agent State** - some of these variables and dynamics summarize to a state for the agent.
- **Overall dynamics**
  - **Value Functions** - Either a single function capturing the overall market value or several functions reflecting the value of individual participants.
  - **External Events** - A mechanism that introduces exogenous shocks—such as major news or policy changes—affecting market conditions over time.
  - **Dynamic Functions** - Functions that govern market-specific aspects, such as transaction costs, liquidity, or general price and flow dynamics.

# Model - Trader
**Key Components for a Trading Algorithm**, Any well-considered trading model must incorporate several elements:
- **Predictions and Conditional Logic** - The algorithm should have predictive capabilities (forecasting future market behavior) and conditional logic to adapt to specific scenarios.
- **Risk Measurements and Statistical Considerations** - Risk management and modeling of potential losses are essential. A robust design contemplates the probability of being wrong and prescribes adjustments—e.g., scaling down positions.
- **Strategic Framework** - Deciding how and when to use derivatives, short selling, or other asset allocations requires a structured policy. The algorithm should recognize when and how to influence or “push” the market.
- **Incorporation of Human Behavior** - Although quantitative in nature, any algorithm benefits from considering behavioral finance aspects—e.g., herding, panic selling, or FOMO (fear of missing out)—that can dominate at certain times.
- **Execution methodology** - sometimes no consideration what so ever about strategy, predictions or risks can still lead to profit, if the execution of a basic idea is immaculate. If I want the price to go up, so I can sell. I may implement an execution method to push the bid or ask prices up.

## Overall model

![Model](https://github.com/COPtoLON/TMRW/blob/2da41e162ce04c25e83712f98d1caf6d9217e76d/util/model.jpg)

## Predictions & Conditional Logical

1. **Statistics** - such as stationarity, regularity, autocorrelations
2. **Market states** - markov etc.
3. **Conditionals** - if UUU, then % chance of D?

## Risk measurements & Statistical considerations

1. VaR, CVaR, Entropy, etc.
2. backtesting risks
3. Statistical certainties
4. Model accuracies

## binomial model or multinomial model on correct moves

## deterministic model on such things as FOMO, resistance levels etc.

## Signal B


## Signal C

## Execution
Expectations & Scenario Analysis

Core assumptions about market trends: bull/bear cycles, sector rotations.
Potential black swan or tail-risk scenarios and how they might affect your strategies.
Competitor analysis: known players in similar strategies and how you differentiate.
Backtesting & Portfolio Allocation (High-Level)

Overarching methodology for backtesting: general assumptions, time horizons.
High-level portfolio allocation considerations: asset classes, geographic diversification.
Strategic performance targets: return expectations by strategy, correlation targets.
Strategic Market Positioning

Rationale for focusing on certain instruments or markets (e.g., equities vs. futures vs. crypto).
Alignment of theoretical assumptions with the practical choice of instruments.
Feedback Loop for Strategy

Process for updating market views and feeding back into strategy design.
Regular intervals for re-evaluating assumptions and adjusting theoretical models.

This is where you bring together your vision for data pipelines, model design, execution procedures, and the “big-picture” logic of how all the moving parts fit together.

Data Architecture & Infrastructure

Data sources: fundamental data, market feeds, alternative data (social media, satellite).
Data cleaning and normalization: how you ensure data quality and consistency.
Data storage and retrieval systems: databases, cloud services, real-time streams.
Model & AI Design

Research pipeline: how new models are proposed, prototyped, validated.
Types of models used: time-series models, machine learning (supervised/unsupervised), deep learning.
Governance for model deployment: versioning, code reviews, performance checks.
Execution Procedures

Order management systems, broker connectivity, and risk checks.
Latency considerations for high-frequency vs. lower-frequency strategies.
Fail-safe mechanisms, circuit breakers, and real-time monitoring dashboards.
Risk & Portfolio Management

Risk frameworks: VaR, stress tests, scenario analyses.
Portfolio construction logic: factor exposures, correlation constraints, max drawdown thresholds.
Consolidation of risk across different strategy “pods” (ensuring the overall portfolio remains balanced).
Return, Concentration & Risk Expectations

Return targets at the strategy and portfolio level.
Concentration limits: sector/industry caps, single-position limits.
Ongoing monitoring: daily/weekly/monthly checks on exposures and performance.
Backtesting & Portfolio Allocation (Detailed)

Standardized backtesting procedures: data lookback periods, walk-forward tests, out-of-sample validation.
Portfolio allocation best practices: weighting schemes, rebalancing frequency.
Integrations with each algorithmic strategy (cross-referenced to the “Algorithmic Strategies” document).



Financial Markets

Optimal Execution & Price Impact: Traders seek to execute large orders without excessive market impact, balancing price drift and volatility (a typical MFG approach).
Systemic Risk: Large numbers of correlated strategies can amplify market drawdowns.
Crowd Dynamics

Pedestrian Movement: Pedestrians are viewed as rational agents aiming to minimize discomfort in crowds, leading to macroscopic flow equations.
Epidemiology

SIR-type Models: Individuals may adapt behaviors in response to an epidemic, and an MFG can describe optimal behavior (distancing, etc.) across a large population.
Branching Scenarios

Population Growth or Exit/Entry Models: Agents “branch” (e.g., a firm splits into subsidiaries) or leave (exit the market). This modifies the equations to handle time-varying population counts.
