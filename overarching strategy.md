# Model - Market
The overall market is an accumulation of the individual agents playing together around a baseline value of a company. The market is represented by the following.
- **Market intrinsic value** - a baseline value of the asset being trading in the market, for stocks, that could be the undeniable value of a company's equity.
- **Market value function** - A single function/time path capturing the overall market value as proposed in unison by all the agents in the market. This will most likely change over time and is the sole reason why we're doing this. To trade and earn on the changes of the value of assets in financial markets.
- **Market variables** -  transaction costs, opening/closing times, date, execution delay, maximum orders per day, etc.
- **Market State** - A summary of the agents behaviour and the market value history makes the market state. It can be trending up, down or sideways, it can be volatile or stable.
- **Market dynamics** - Returning behaviours, such as W shapes, limits, seasonalities, reactions to market news...
- **External events** - news, FED actions, catastrophies, political events... A mechanism that introduces exogenous shocks—such as major news or policy changes—affecting market conditions over time.

# Model - Agent
- **Agent goals** - Each agent has a goal aiming to extract and maximize value from the market.
- **Agent market share** - Each agent can measure its value by a combined measurement of current piece value and the agents share of the market.
- **Agent value function** - market share times market piece value, a single function reflecting the value of the individual participant's share value. the sum of all the pieces is the value of the market.
- **Agent dynamics** - Each agent can perform a range of actions, each agent has a relationship to the other agents, and an information coefficient, there will be considerations on agent sizes
- **Agent variables** - Each agent has a resistance to the information and actions of other agents, each agent has a consideration on the correct price range and an opinion of which direction the price should move, they also have a trading book(money in the bank, portfolio, etc.) and a take-profit and stop-loss value.
- **External Events** - External events, that affect the agent also occur, some agents may or may not be affected by market external events, but some agents may also be affected by external events unique for that particular agent.
- **Agent State** - Each agent therefore has an internal state, where both market behaviour and internal behaviour is taken into consideration.


# Model - Hierarchically Layered Time-Frame Architecture
The guiding idea is to separate trading strategies by time horizon and then align them so each layer can reinforce or hedge the others. Hierarchically layered framework that integrates multiple time frames and strategies to optimize trading performance. 
The concept behind this model is based on mean field games (MFG)
The model operates across four layers, each with distinct time frames, objectives, risk parameters, and predictive logic. Below is the structured plan.

## Layer 1 - HFT
- Time Horizon: Sub-seconds to a few seconds/minutes.
- Objectives:
  - Market-making; capturing bid–ask spread.
  - Statistical arbitrage with a near-zero net position target.
  - Fine-grained order-execution tactics, exploiting microstructure.
- Key Traits:
  - Extremely fast decision-making.
  - Position goal ≈ 0 at all times to minimize overnight risk.
  - Focus on liquidity provision and capturing small, repeated profits.

## Layer 2 - Short
- Time Horizon: A few minutes up to a few days.
- Objectives:
  - Mean reversion.
  - Short-term volatility trading (e.g., trading around expected earnings announcements, news catalysts, or technical signals).
- Key Traits:
  - Position goal ≠ 0, but still relatively small.
  - Higher frequency than long-horizon, but less than HFT.
  - Trades or holds positions for short windows to capitalize on rapid but not instantaneous market moves.

## Layer 3 - Medium
- Time Horizon: A few days up to a few weeks.
- Objectives:
  - Mean reversion on longer cycles (e.g., cyclical trends, seasonal patterns).
  - Volatility trading on macro events (e.g., central bank announcements).
- Key Traits:
  - Larger position sizes than short-term strategies, depending on broader market or sector trends.
  - More thorough risk analytics, including macro factors and cross-asset correlations.

## Layer 4 - Long
- Time Horizon: A few weeks to multiple years.
- Objectives:
  - Thematic or fundamental investing (a la Bridgewater, Warren Buffett).
  - Accumulation of strategic positions for fundamental value or macro growth.
- Key Traits:
  - Typically directional, either net long or net short.
  - Focus on deep fundamental analysis, Macro level investing, and possibly ESG or large-scale portfolio constraints.

## Layer 5 - Eons

# Model Version 1.

**Key Components for a Trading Algorithm**, Any well-considered trading model must incorporate several elements:
- **Predictions and Conditional Logic** - The algorithm should have predictive capabilities (forecasting future market behavior) and conditional logic to adapt to specific scenarios.
- **Risk Measurements and Statistical Considerations** - Risk management and modeling of potential losses are essential. A robust design contemplates the probability of being wrong and prescribes adjustments—e.g., scaling down positions.
- **Strategic Framework** - Deciding how and when to use derivatives, short selling, or other asset allocations requires a structured policy. The algorithm should recognize when and how to influence or “push” the market.
- **Incorporation of Human Behavior** - Although quantitative in nature, any algorithm benefits from considering behavioral finance aspects—e.g., herding, panic selling, or FOMO (fear of missing out)—that can dominate at certain times.
- **Execution methodology** - sometimes no consideration what so ever about strategy, predictions or risks can still lead to profit, if the execution of a basic idea is immaculate. If I want the price to go up, so I can sell. I may implement an execution method to push the bid or ask prices up.

# Model version 2.
- **Layer 1 - HFT**
  - Ultra low frequency - Market-making, Statistical arbitrage, etc. : position goal = 0
- **Layer 2 - short**
  - Short( a few minutes up to a few days) - Mean-reversion, volatility trading? : Position goal = +- x
- **Layer 3 - Medium**
  - Medium( a day to a few weeks) - Mean-reversion, volatility trading? : Position goal = +- x
- **Layer 4 - Long**
  - Long( a few weeks to years) - bridgewater associates? Warren buffett? Long: Position goal = +- x

**Run prediction + risk + ai stuff on the short to long time frames, run only taking profit on the HFT time frames?**

Expectations & Scenario Analysis

Core assumptions about market trends: bull/bear cycles, sector rotations.
Potential black swan or tail-risk scenarios and how they might affect your strategies.

Data cleaning and normalization: how you ensure data quality and consistency.
Data storage and retrieval systems: databases, cloud services, real-time streams.
Model & AI Design

Research pipeline: how new models are proposed, prototyped, validated.
Types of models used: time-series models, machine learning (supervised/unsupervised), deep learning.
Governance for model deployment: versioning, code reviews, performance checks.
Execution Procedures

Order management systems, broker connectivity, and risk checks.

Return, Concentration & Risk Expectations

Return targets at the strategy and portfolio level.
Concentration limits: sector/industry caps, single-position limits.

Backtesting & Portfolio Allocation (Detailed)

Standardized backtesting procedures: data lookback periods, walk-forward tests, out-of-sample validation.
Portfolio allocation best practices: weighting schemes, rebalancing frequency.
Integrations with each algorithmic strategy (cross-referenced to the “Algorithmic Strategies” document).



Financial Markets

Optimal Execution & Price Impact: Traders seek to execute large orders without excessive market impact, balancing price drift and volatility (a typical MFG approach).
Systemic Risk: Large numbers of correlated strategies can amplify market drawdowns.
Crowd Dynamics

Pedestrian Movement: Pedestrians are viewed as rational agents aiming to minimize discomfort in crowds, leading to macroscopic flow equations.
Epidemiology

SIR-type Models: Individuals may adapt behaviors in response to an epidemic, and an MFG can describe optimal behavior (distancing, etc.) across a large population.
Branching Scenarios

Population Growth or Exit/Entry Models: Agents “branch” (e.g., a firm splits into subsidiaries) or leave (exit the market). This modifies the equations to handle time-varying population counts.
