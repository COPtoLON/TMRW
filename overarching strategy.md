This is where you bring together your vision for data pipelines, model design, execution procedures, and the “big-picture” logic of how all the moving parts fit together.

Data Architecture & Infrastructure

Data sources: fundamental data, market feeds, alternative data (social media, satellite).
Data cleaning and normalization: how you ensure data quality and consistency.
Data storage and retrieval systems: databases, cloud services, real-time streams.
Model & AI Design

Research pipeline: how new models are proposed, prototyped, validated.
Types of models used: time-series models, machine learning (supervised/unsupervised), deep learning.
Governance for model deployment: versioning, code reviews, performance checks.
Execution Procedures

Order management systems, broker connectivity, and risk checks.
Latency considerations for high-frequency vs. lower-frequency strategies.
Fail-safe mechanisms, circuit breakers, and real-time monitoring dashboards.
Risk & Portfolio Management

Risk frameworks: VaR, stress tests, scenario analyses.
Portfolio construction logic: factor exposures, correlation constraints, max drawdown thresholds.
Consolidation of risk across different strategy “pods” (ensuring the overall portfolio remains balanced).
Return, Concentration & Risk Expectations

Return targets at the strategy and portfolio level.
Concentration limits: sector/industry caps, single-position limits.
Ongoing monitoring: daily/weekly/monthly checks on exposures and performance.
Backtesting & Portfolio Allocation (Detailed)

Standardized backtesting procedures: data lookback periods, walk-forward tests, out-of-sample validation.
Portfolio allocation best practices: weighting schemes, rebalancing frequency.
Integrations with each algorithmic strategy (cross-referenced to the “Algorithmic Strategies” document).
