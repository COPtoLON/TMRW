Expectations & Scenario Analysis

Core assumptions about market trends: bull/bear cycles, sector rotations.
Potential black swan or tail-risk scenarios and how they might affect your strategies.
Competitor analysis: known players in similar strategies and how you differentiate.
Backtesting & Portfolio Allocation (High-Level)

Overarching methodology for backtesting: general assumptions, time horizons.
High-level portfolio allocation considerations: asset classes, geographic diversification.
Strategic performance targets: return expectations by strategy, correlation targets.
Strategic Market Positioning

Rationale for focusing on certain instruments or markets (e.g., equities vs. futures vs. crypto).
Alignment of theoretical assumptions with the practical choice of instruments.
Feedback Loop for Strategy

Process for updating market views and feeding back into strategy design.
Regular intervals for re-evaluating assumptions and adjusting theoretical models.

This is where you bring together your vision for data pipelines, model design, execution procedures, and the “big-picture” logic of how all the moving parts fit together.

Data Architecture & Infrastructure

Data sources: fundamental data, market feeds, alternative data (social media, satellite).
Data cleaning and normalization: how you ensure data quality and consistency.
Data storage and retrieval systems: databases, cloud services, real-time streams.
Model & AI Design

Research pipeline: how new models are proposed, prototyped, validated.
Types of models used: time-series models, machine learning (supervised/unsupervised), deep learning.
Governance for model deployment: versioning, code reviews, performance checks.
Execution Procedures

Order management systems, broker connectivity, and risk checks.
Latency considerations for high-frequency vs. lower-frequency strategies.
Fail-safe mechanisms, circuit breakers, and real-time monitoring dashboards.
Risk & Portfolio Management

Risk frameworks: VaR, stress tests, scenario analyses.
Portfolio construction logic: factor exposures, correlation constraints, max drawdown thresholds.
Consolidation of risk across different strategy “pods” (ensuring the overall portfolio remains balanced).
Return, Concentration & Risk Expectations

Return targets at the strategy and portfolio level.
Concentration limits: sector/industry caps, single-position limits.
Ongoing monitoring: daily/weekly/monthly checks on exposures and performance.
Backtesting & Portfolio Allocation (Detailed)

Standardized backtesting procedures: data lookback periods, walk-forward tests, out-of-sample validation.
Portfolio allocation best practices: weighting schemes, rebalancing frequency.
Integrations with each algorithmic strategy (cross-referenced to the “Algorithmic Strategies” document).


## Concluding Thoughts
Mean-field games blend ideas from game theory, stochastic processes, and control theory. Their strength lies in managing large-agent systems where each agent’s individual impact is small, but collectively significant. In trading contexts—like those faced by hedge funds (Jane Street, Two Sigma, Citadel, etc.)—the MFG framework can help reason about the interplay between a single agent’s optimal strategy and the aggregate market behavior.

By clarifying the ideas of market dynamics, game-theoretic interactions, and advanced modeling (through PDEs or branching processes), one can more rigorously capture how agents attempt to maximize their outcomes under uncertainty, competition, and continuous adaptation.

Financial Markets

Optimal Execution & Price Impact: Traders seek to execute large orders without excessive market impact, balancing price drift and volatility (a typical MFG approach).
Systemic Risk: Large numbers of correlated strategies can amplify market drawdowns.
Crowd Dynamics

Pedestrian Movement: Pedestrians are viewed as rational agents aiming to minimize discomfort in crowds, leading to macroscopic flow equations.
Epidemiology

SIR-type Models: Individuals may adapt behaviors in response to an epidemic, and an MFG can describe optimal behavior (distancing, etc.) across a large population.
Branching Scenarios

Population Growth or Exit/Entry Models: Agents “branch” (e.g., a firm splits into subsidiaries) or leave (exit the market). This modifies the equations to handle time-varying population counts.







# Company Trading Algorithm
Any good and thought-through trading algorithm must have some considerations on the following:
- Predictions and conditional logic based on scenarios, a good algorithm, has some predictive properties and some conditional logic properties. Being able to discern some scenarios from others.
- Risk measurements and statistical considerations, to be able to consider the possibilities of being wrong and what to do if such a case occurs.
- A genuine strategical framework, so as to know when to set up derivatives, when to short, go long or when to actively push the market.

A genuine trading algorithm, must also know human behaviour. To be able to consider when to be active or passive. When to switch strategies.


## Key Components for a Trading Algorithm
Any well-considered trading algorithm must incorporate several elements:

### Predictions and Conditional Logic
The algorithm should have predictive capabilities (forecasting future market behavior) and conditional logic to adapt to specific scenarios.

### Risk Measurements and Statistical Considerations
Risk management and modeling of potential losses are essential. A robust design contemplates the probability of being wrong and prescribes adjustments—e.g., scaling down positions.

### Strategic Framework
Deciding how and when to use derivatives, short selling, or other asset allocations requires a structured policy. The algorithm should recognize when and how to influence or “push” the market.

### Incorporation of Human Behavior
Although quantitative in nature, any algorithm benefits from considering behavioral finance aspects—e.g., herding, panic selling, or FOMO (fear of missing out)—that can dominate at certain times.
