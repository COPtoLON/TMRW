# Market expectations
This document is meant to serve as a manifest to describe the company's expectations about the market it would be operating in. It could also be considered an operational expectation plan.
It will cover all our overarching views on markets, competitor landscapes, and key theoretical underpinnings. It might also serve as a “living” market outlook and theoretical playbook.

# Macro & Micro Market considerations
The markets, this company will be operating in, will have multiple layers. There will be:
- Macroeconomic factors: interest rates, inflation, global economic indicators.
- Market microstructure considerations: liquidity, order book dynamics, transaction costs.
- Theoretical considerations (e.g., Efficient Market Hypothesis vs. Adaptive Market Hypothesis).
- external events
- market participant effects

# Market dynamics
We can imagine a system consisting of multiple agents—referred to as partakers—each endowed with a certain measure. The overarching goal is for each agent to maximize its own measure, which might represent profit, wealth, or another relevant metric. This is a broad framework in which a trading algorithm would naturally be a sub-problem, aiming to maximize gains under certain constraints (e.g., risk limits, available market liquidity).

Hedge funds and proprietary trading firms such as Jane Street, Two Sigma, and Citadel engage in strategies that may be modeled in part by mean-field game (MFG) theory. Each firm (agent) interacts with the market (population), exerting small influences individually but collectively driving overall behavior.

Jane Street could be viewed as seeking an optimal strategy that accounts for large-population effects—this might be reflected in a mean-field approach.\
Two Sigma might specialize in systematically exploiting “edges” that arise from aggregate behavior.\
Citadel might “own the playing field” through broad market participation, typically gleaning minimal gains per transaction on large volume.\
Other funds may focus on volatility or on absorbing mispriced risk from weaker strategies.\
Despite nuanced differences, all of these perspectives can be placed under an umbrella of large-population, strategic decision-making, a natural setting for mean-field games.

## Key Components for a Trading Algorithm
Any well-considered trading algorithm must incorporate several elements:

### Predictions and Conditional Logic
The algorithm should have predictive capabilities (forecasting future market behavior) and conditional logic to adapt to specific scenarios.

### Risk Measurements and Statistical Considerations
Risk management and modeling of potential losses are essential. A robust design contemplates the probability of being wrong and prescribes adjustments—e.g., scaling down positions.

### Strategic Framework
Deciding how and when to use derivatives, short selling, or other asset allocations requires a structured policy. The algorithm should recognize when and how to influence or “push” the market.

### Incorporation of Human Behavior
Although quantitative in nature, any algorithm benefits from considering behavioral finance aspects—e.g., herding, panic selling, or FOMO (fear of missing out)—that can dominate at certain times.

## Mean-Field Game Theory
Mean-field game (MFG) theory studies how strategic decision-making unfolds among many “small” agents in a large population. Each agent’s individual influence on the system is negligible, yet collectively these agents drive its overall dynamics. The term “mean field” is borrowed from physics, where the behavior of large systems can often be approximated by examining one representative particle in an “average” field created by the others.

### Traditional Game Theory vs. MFG:
In standard (often two-player) game theory, we might rely on backward induction. This becomes difficult when dealing with a large number of players over continuous time. MFGs tackle this by letting the number of players go to infinity, introducing a representative agent whose behavior and optimal strategies become indicative of the whole population.

### Key PDEs:
Typically, MFGs in continuous time are associated with a coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation (describing each agent’s optimal control) and a Fokker–Planck (or Kolmogorov) equation (tracking the aggregate distribution). Under suitable assumptions, an $N$-player Nash equilibrium converges to the MFG solution as $N \to \infty$

### Branching Versions & Extensions:
When agents can enter or leave the game (e.g., a new agent “spawned” under certain conditions), classical MFGs extend to branching mean-field games. This can be relevant for modeling demographic changes in an economy or repeated entry/exit in trading contexts.


## Mean-Field Game Equations (Classical Form)
A canonical MFG problem in continuous time and a state space $\mathbb{R}^d$ includes:

### Backward HJB Equation:

$$-\partial_t u(t,x) - \nu \Delta u(t,x) + H(x,m(t), \nabla u(t,x)) = 0,$$

subject to a terminal/goal condition $u(T,x)=G(x,m(T))$

### Forward Fokker–Planck (or Kolmogorov) Equation:

$$\partial_t m(t,x) - \nu \Delta m(t,x) - div(\nabla_p H(x,m(t), \nabla u(t,x)), m(t,x)) = 0,$$

with some initial condition $m(0)=m_0.$

Here:
- $u(t,x)$ is the value function for a typical agent starting at 
- $m(t)$ is the distribution of agent states at time
- $\nu$ is a diffusion coefficient (or viscosity parameter).
- $H$ is the Hamiltonian encoding the running cost and dynamics, while $G$ is a terminal cost functional.
