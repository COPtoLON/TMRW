# Market expectations
This document outlines the company's expectations and operational plans for its target markets. It offers a comprehensive view of market conditions, competitive landscapes, and key theoretical principles, and is intended to serve as a “living” resource—evolving over time as our market outlook and strategic insights develop.

## Macro & Micro Market Considerations
Our target markets have multiple interconnected layers:
1. **Macroeconomic Factors:** Examples include interest rates, inflation trends, and global economic indicators.
2. **Market Microstructure:** Covers liquidity, order book dynamics, and transaction costs.
3. **Theoretical Perspectives:** Ranges from the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) to the Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH), each influencing strategic approaches.
4. **External Events:** News releases, economic crises, or policy changes can significantly shift market conditions.
5. **Participant Effects:** Competitors or other market players can alter price flows, potentially impacting our strategies or eroding profits.

Additionally, we should consider “blue-ocean vs. red-ocean” scenarios—i.e., markets with uncontested vs. highly contested space—and whether we plan to change our participation mode (neutral, defensive, offensive, or reactive) frequently or infrequently.

## Operational Considerations
A broad range of tactical approaches is available in these markets, including:
- **Long Positions** – Buying and holding assets.
- **Short Positions** – Borrowing and selling assets in anticipation of price declines.
- **Derivatives Usage** – Incorporating options, futures, or swaps to refine positioning and risk profiles.
- **Arbitrage** – Exploiting price discrepancies across different exchanges.
- **Leverage** – Borrowing capital to scale or amplify positions.
- **Market Making** – Setting bid/ask quotes to gauge sentiment and capture spread opportunities.

## Market Participants
Participant visibility will vary:
- **Observable** – We can gauge some order flow directly, seeing bid-ask spreads and market depth.
- **Less Observable** – We often cannot identify which specific entity placed a trade without specialized data. Subscribing to more sophisticated market feeds or partnering with data providers may be necessary for deeper insights.

## Potential “Edges”
Certain areas remain under-optimized or heavily contested, presenting opportunities for differentiation:

- **Execution Speed** – Algorithmic efficiency and low-latency connectivity to exchanges.
- **Computational & Predictive Accuracy** – High-precision modeling and forecasting.
- **Market Coverage** – Maintaining broad coverage across multiple instruments or venues while minimizing impact.
- **Stealth & Adaptability** – Executing trades with minimal market signaling and pivoting strategies quickly when conditions change.
- **Strategic Decision-Making** – Informed, agile approaches that leverage real-time data for competitive advantage.
These edges represent our potential pathways to outperformance. By focusing on innovation in speed, predictive power, and flexible execution, we aim to thrive in a competitive market landscape.


# Model
By integrating these considerations, we approximate a model for the markets in which we operate. We anticipate that any such market will exhibit the following characteristics:

1. **Value Functions** - Either a single function capturing the overall market value or several functions reflecting the value of individual participants.

2. **Agent Goals** - A collection of market participants or agents, each aiming—much like our own strategy—to extract and maximize value from the market.

3. **States & Variables** - Every participant carries a “state,” comprised of one or more variables that influence or determine their impact on outcomes.

4. **Market & Participant Variables** - A set of parameters or inputs shaping both the market’s collective behavior and the participants’ decision-making processes.

5. **External Events** - A mechanism that introduces exogenous shocks—such as major news or policy changes—affecting market conditions over time.

6. **Dynamic Functions** - Functions that govern market-specific aspects, such as transaction costs, liquidity, or general price and flow dynamics.
