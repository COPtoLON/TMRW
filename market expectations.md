# Market expectations
This document outlines the company's expectations and operational plans for its target markets. It offers a comprehensive view of market conditions, competitive landscapes, and key theoretical principles, and is intended to serve as a “living” resource—evolving over time as our market outlook and strategic insights develop.

## Macro & Micro Market Considerations
Our target markets have multiple interconnected layers:
1. Macroeconomic Factors: Examples include interest rates, inflation trends, and global economic indicators.
2. Market Microstructure: Covers liquidity, order book dynamics, and transaction costs.
3. Theoretical Perspectives: Ranges from the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) to the Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH), each influencing strategic approaches.
4. External Events: News releases, economic crises, or policy changes can significantly shift market conditions.
5. Participant Effects: Competitors or other market players can alter price flows, potentially impacting our strategies or eroding profits.

Additionally, we should consider “blue-ocean vs. red-ocean” scenarios—i.e., markets with uncontested vs. highly contested space—and whether we plan to change our participation mode (neutral, defensive, offensive, or reactive) frequently or infrequently.

## Operational Considerations
A broad range of tactical approaches is available in these markets, including:
- Long Positions – Buying and holding assets.
- Short Positions – Borrowing and selling assets in anticipation of price declines.
- Derivatives Usage – Incorporating options, futures, or swaps to refine positioning and risk profiles.
- Arbitrage – Exploiting price discrepancies across different exchanges.
- Leverage – Borrowing capital to scale or amplify positions.
- Market Making – Setting bid/ask quotes to gauge sentiment and capture spread opportunities.

## Market Participants
Participant visibility will vary:
- Observable – We can gauge some order flow directly, seeing bid-ask spreads and market depth.
- Less Observable – We often cannot identify which specific entity placed a trade without specialized data. Subscribing to more sophisticated market feeds or partnering with data providers may be necessary for deeper insights.

## Potential “Edges”
Certain areas remain under-optimized or heavily contested, presenting opportunities for differentiation:

- Execution Speed – Algorithmic efficiency and low-latency connectivity to exchanges.
- Computational & Predictive Accuracy – High-precision modeling and forecasting.
- Market Coverage – Maintaining broad coverage across multiple instruments or venues while minimizing impact.
- Stealth & Adaptability – Executing trades with minimal market signaling and pivoting strategies quickly when conditions change.
- Strategic Decision-Making – Informed, agile approaches that leverage real-time data for competitive advantage.
These edges represent our potential pathways to outperformance. By focusing on innovation in speed, predictive power, and flexible execution, we aim to thrive in a competitive market landscape.


# Model
Putting these considerations together, we obtain an approximation to a model of the markets we opperate in.
We expect for any market we operate in to have the following.

1. A function describing the value of the collective market or a series of functions describing the value of each market participant.
2. A range of agents or participants seeking a corresponding goal to ours, to obtain value from the market and maximize their share.
3. Each agent or participant has a state, with one or multiple variables corresponding to effects of the state.
4. A series of variables effecting the market and a series of variables effecting the participants
5. A function to induce the corresponding external events
6. A range of functions representing the market dynamics, such as transaction cost, liquidity, dynamics etc.
