*This document covers how the hedge fund is run at the business and operational level.*

# Mission & Vision
The primary goal of our hedge fund is to preserve and optimize its overall value. We will carefully balance minimizing risk with achieving the highest possible returns. This objective takes inspiration from the concept of a single particle in an open system and the research on algorithms that optimize and conserve enthalpy or energy.

To finance our operations, we will seek funding from investors while keeping the investor base streamlined—thus minimizing the number of individuals who can directly influence our business model. We plan to do this by offering two share classes:
* Class A shares, granting voting rights, and
* Class B shares, providing a path to returns without conferring voting authority.

Our target is to consistently deliver annual returns above 30% with minimal risk, regardless of market conditions. We plan to achieve this by adhering to the company’s overarching strategy: **Expand, Establish, Excel, Repeat.** which works to both diversify and accelerate returns.

# Overarching strategy

**Goal: To optimally balance returns and risks, to gain a risk-adjusted ROI of 30% or more per year perpetually** \
The expected process to obtain our goals will be the following:
Repeat the following process.
- Expand into new markets, strategies, or assets.
- Establish a solid foundation in each new area.
- Assess ongoing market states (neutral, aggressive, defensive, or counter).
- Excel in profitability regardless of the market’s state.
- Repeat the cycle, continuously searching for new expansion opportunities.

## Expand
### Identifying New Opportunities
The first step involves scouting new possibilities. For an algorithmic trading firm (or any investment company), this generally boils down to three broad dimensions:

* Strategy – e.g., mean-reversion, momentum, pairs trading, event-based trading, etc.
* Asset Class – e.g., equities, fixed income, real estate, crypto.
* Market/Region – e.g., North America, Europe, Asia, emerging markets.

Instead of jumping into everything at once, successful companies look for areas where they can leverage existing expertise. For example, if the firm is already adept at high-frequency mean-reversion for US equities, a natural expansion might be into pairs trading or statistical arbitrage on European equity markets, rather than pivoting abruptly to an entirely different asset class or time horizon.

### Balancing Costs and Diversification
Expansion is rarely cheap:

* R&D Expenses – You need new data feeds, models, compliance procedures, etc.
* Opportunity Cost – Diverting resources (capital and talent) from existing profitable ventures.
* Risk of Failure – New strategies or markets might not pan out, potentially hurting both morale and P&L.

On the plus side, each new strategy or asset can diversify revenue streams, reducing reliance on a single source of profit. The decision to expand (and how aggressively to do so) often hinges on your firm’s risk tolerance, available capital, and the competitive landscape.


## Establish

### Development and Testing
Once the decision to expand is made. Say, from statistical arbitrage into pairs trading.\
The real work of establishing the new strategy (or venture) begins. This typically includes:

* Initial Research & Backtesting – Validate the theoretical or historical viability of the idea.
* Systems Architecture – Adapt (or build) technology stacks to accommodate new data flows, trading algorithms, and risk checks.
* Regulatory & Compliance – Ensure you meet all the necessary legal requirements (especially crucial if you move into new markets or product types).

### Gradual Roll-Out
Firms often start small. Perhaps running the new strategy with minimal capital and tight risk parameters, before scaling up. \
During this period, the team refines the approach by:

* Collecting real-world execution data.
* Adjusting for live market slippage, latency, or unexpected events.
* Fine-tuning triggers, risk models, and asset selection.
* Encountering Competition (“States” of Play)

During establishment, you begin to see how rivals (and the market) respond:
* Blue Ocean – Little direct competition; it’s relatively easy to gain market share or profits.
* Red Ocean – Aggressive competition; others may:
   * Attack by front-running or copying your trades.
   * Defend by altering their own strategies to reduce your edge.
   * Counter by placing offsetting trades that exploit weaknesses in your newly established approach.

This is where the “Defensive, Aggressive, Counter, or Neutral” states come into play. You might:
* Defend your strategy by tightening risk controls, reducing information leakage, or adapting signals.
* Go Aggressive if you see a direct, time-limited window to outmaneuver competitors—e.g., quickly scaling up before they can react.
* Counter if competitors attempt to undermine your profitability—e.g., using options to hedge out the effect of a rival’s short attack.
* Remain Neutral (or continue your preplanned path) if the environment is stable, or if you believe changing tactics doesn’t improve your edge.

## Excel
### Achieving Steady Profitability
Once your new venture (strategy, asset class, or market) is established and your firm has adapted to the competitive landscape, the aim is to excel—i.e., realize consistent, sustainable returns. Excelling might involve:
* Ongoing Optimization – Continuously tweak the algorithm (or business model) to respond to new data, changing market microstructures, and evolving competitor behavior.
* Risk Management – Monitor and adjust exposure in real time to maintain risk at acceptable levels (e.g., volatility targets, drawdown limits).
* Scalability – Ensure that as you put on larger trades or handle more volume, your infrastructure, capital, and risk frameworks can keep pace.

### Maintaining the Edge
“Excel” also means holding on to (and refining) your advantage in the face of decay. In quantitative finance, alpha signals degrade quickly once they’re discovered or widely used. A firm that excels typically:
* Has a robust R&D pipeline to keep finding small improvements or new alpha signals.
* Employs portfolio management techniques that combine multiple signals or strategies, reducing the reliance on any single “secret sauce.”
* Maintains a talent pipeline of data scientists, quantitative researchers, and traders who can continuously refine existing ideas and explore new ones.

### Feed-Forward Into the Next Cycle
Once you’re comfortably in the “Excel” phase—achieving stable profitability in your new strategy, asset class, or market—you effectively repeat the cycle:
* Look for the next angle to exploit (i.e., Expand again).
* Establish the new approach or venture with the knowledge and proceeds from your current successes.
* Excel anew, eventually building a diversified ecosystem of profitable strategies across multiple markets.

## Additional Thoughts
The Expand → Establish → Excel framework is intended to be cyclical. Each time you master a new area, you use that footing to expand yet again. In the fast-paced world of algorithmic trading, you’re never done growing—either you innovate or you risk being outpaced by competitors (who, at any moment, might be looking to attack, defend, or counter your positions).

### Moreover, each step has a feedback loop:
- Success in one domain funds exploration in another.
- Failures or market shifts in one area teach valuable lessons that can refine strategies, technology, and risk management for the next venture.

By continually cycling through Expand, Establish, and Excel—with acute awareness of the market “states” (defensive, aggressive, counter, or neutral)—a quantitative firm can build a resilient and adaptive portfolio of strategies that stand the test of an ever-evolving market landscape.

**from here and down, I will still have to work out some reflections on the corporate structure and operational roadmap**

# Corporate Structure

### Company map
![Corporate Structure](https://github.com/COPtoLON/TMRW/blob/ac464545aa1d5634eaa8a9d53328853d2a69550b/util/corporate%20structure.jpg)
<br>
**Roles and responsibilities:** 
Deeper consideration must be given to key roles such as the Board of Directors, CEO, Portfolio Managers, and Quantitative Researchers. I have not yet delved into the finer details of corporate, compliance, and legal structures for such an organization, but I plan to explore these aspects in the future.

For now, my focus has been on optimizing the performance of each trading or strategy pod. I recognize that my awareness of the high standards involved may also explain why I currently see few job opportunities at such firms, akin to what I am proposing here, my mind goes to companies such as Two Sigma, Citadel, Man AHL, Millenium Management.

In a venture of this nature, every position—from junior operations to quantitative research—must be filled by individuals who are exceptionally capable, quick to learn, detail-oriented, and well-versed in their respective area of expertise. Simply put, there is no room for error, even in roles that might seem less significant.

# Operational Roadmap
An important goal, would be to have an operational roadmap, wherein there would be the following:
- Timeline for acquiring key personnel (quant analysts, data scientists, risk managers).
- Timeline for acquiring resources (technology infrastructure, data subscriptions, etc.).
- Timeline for fundraising (seed investments, institutional investors, etc. ).
- Milestones for expanding operations—e.g., from a single-strategy fund to multi-strategy pods.
- legal & compliance requirements fulfilled (SEC registration, regulatory compliance, legal counsel involvement).
<br>

## Plan for hiring key personnel 
*this is sadly unfinished for the moment*
<br>
## Plan for company resources
*this is sadly unfinished for the moment*
<br>

## Fundraising plan
Investor communication plans: periodic performance reports, annual meetings, newsletters.
Growth plans for Assets Under Management (AUM) over time.

## Compliance framework 
(SEC registration, regulatory compliance, legal counsel involvement).

<br>

## Long-term strategy & Milestones
from small specialized fund to multi-market global fund
- Year 1 annualized return target
- Year 1 Sharpe ratio
- Year 1 drawdown limits
