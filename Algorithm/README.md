## Mathematical “Field–Agent” System
User proposal: A multi-layer model with
- Foundational frame = dynamic geometric field (curvature, holes, indents)
- Agents = entities with actions, policies (external dynamics), strategies (internal dynamics), cost/value functions, and coupling graphs
- Informational layer = dynamic network that propagates history, couplings and group structures
We formalized it as a hybrid dynamical system on manifolds (state vector = geometry + fields + network + agent states).
Added: sudden topology/metric jumps & complex-valued variables.
Gave a one-line “master equation” (flow + jump maps) and linked to physical, game-theoretic, ML, and philosophical frameworks.

## Quant-Finance Recon & Curation
Identified cutting-edge methods for mid- and low-frequency trading:
- Deep-representation models (Transformers, T-GAT, FinGPT)
- Mean-field/broker games for order-flow toxicity
- RL execution agents, dynamic Kelly sizing, rough-vol surfaces, Chebyshev interp.

## User Requirements for Production Framework
Focus asset: Cryptocurrencies (vs. equities)
Dual horizon: ultra-low latency (sub-ms) first, then modular medium-freq (hours–days).
Exchanges: Binance, OKX, Coinbase, Robinhood, ...
Tech: Python primary, C++ for speed-critical paths.
Leverage: flexible.

## Delivered Design Document
Architecture: data-ingestion bus (Redis/Kafka) → feature engine → strategy modules → C++ order manager → risk manager → monitoring/logging.
Strategy stack:
- Ultra-low-latency: market making, cross-exchange / triangular arb, micro-order-flow predictors.
- Medium-frequency: momentum/trend, mean-reversion, LSTM/Transformer predictors, on-chain factors, DeFi arb.
Tech stack: CCXT for exchange API, PyTorch/TF, PyBind11 C++ kernels, PostgreSQL/Timescale, Docker/Grafana.
Workflow: prototype → paper-trade → C++ optimisation → staged release → live risk dashboards.
